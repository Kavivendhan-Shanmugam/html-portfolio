<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi guys</h2>

<p>Hi everyone! I’m Kavivendhan Shanmugam, currently pursuing my B.E. in Computer Science Engineering with a focus on Cyber Security. I’m thrilled that you’ve made it here and are considering exploring my website. </p>

<p>I’ve recently embarked on my journey as a developer, and my goal is to succeed while enjoying the process. At this stage, I may not have much to share about myself, but I’m eager to learn and grow. If you have any tips or advice for me, please feel free to reach out via email.

<p>Thank you for visiting, and I appreciate your support!</p>
